Dear Turker,

We have a new task in store for you - "Complex Question Creation" which will be launched on April 12, 1PM (EST). We invite you to participate in it!
Your task will be to form questions that require multiple steps of reasoning, using snippets of conversations.

Please go through the detailed instructions for this task: https://shorturl.at/ejsO6
You will have to pass a qualification test: https://worker.mturk.com/qualifications/3DA2M59FD03MKSVQ6KIPVI7Q8Y2RXF 
Please note: You need to get at least 5 out of 6 correct. We are currently accepting workers who have completed at least 500 HIT with an acceptance rate of 95%. Upon passing the qualification test and submitting a HIT, you will be awarded $1.0 bonus. Qualified workers will be notified via email when the task is live.

The pay for the task is completely bonus-based, which will depend on the number of complex questions provided. Please refer to the instructions for more details. We will evaluate the work and roll out payments within 5 working days of completing the task.
If you observe an issue, please let us know by responding to this email (or even sending a screenshot).

Cheers,
QA Research
